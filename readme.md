# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project predicts the temperature of **City D** using historical temperature data from **Cities A, B, and C**. The model is trained on past weather patterns and uses machine learning techniques to forecast future temperatures. 🏆 **This project won 1st place in IIT Shaastra's AIML Challenge 2!** 🏆

🛠️ Model Overview
The model takes temperature data from Cities A, B, and C as input and predicts the temperature of City D. The approach includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model training using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and Google Colab.

📊 Dataset
train.csv: Contains historical temperature data for model training.
test.csv: Contains unseen data for model evaluation.
🏆 Hackathon Recognition
This project was developed as part of IIT Shaastra AIML Challenge 2 and was declared winners. Our model was recognized for its accuracy, innovation, and practical approach to weather forecasting.
